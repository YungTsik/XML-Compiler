# XML-like Language Compiler

###This project focuses on two main processes of a compiler; the lexical and the syntax analysis. It was made during the "Principles of Programming Languages & Compilers" course at CEID, University of Patras.
---
We took into account a small portion of XML elements (root and components) and with the flex & bison tools we created the lexical and the syntax analysts. When running the parser, it shows if the given code is wrong in the structure and/or has typos, and finally gives the user specific error messages.
The *input* file has an example of all the allowed elements and attributes.
